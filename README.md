# Win95CDKey
CD Key "genner" for Windows 95 

Windows 95 CDKEY generator made in ~10 minutes in TurboWarp

# Source File
`Warning: You must open the sb3 file in [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org). The file has a clipboard extension which is unsupported in Scratch 3 and will not load properly.

# Guide
Click on the dango when you open the project page and it will automatically run. Wait until you hear the tada sound and allow clipboard access. It'll be copied and the code should work. Try a key validator like [this](https://github.com/MobCat/Windows-95-Product-Key-Check).

# Credits
I tested using the previously mentioned [key checker](https://github.com/MobCat/Windows-95-Product-Key-Check).
I found the requirements of how the key SHOULD be using [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwyH59nACzQ)
